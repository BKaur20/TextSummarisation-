We need to continue this work until the end of the outbreak, to keep the capacity in place to rapidly respond to flare-ups, to keep supporting survivors after the outbreak, and to transition the capacities built in this response toward building a stronger health system.  
But to be very frank, right now the world risks dropping the baton at the finish line. WHO faces an immediate US $20 million funding gap. 
If no new resources are received, we will run out of money before the end of the outbreak. We appreciate the generosity of donors who have supported the response since August 2018.
 WHO is calling on the international community to help us end this outbreak, and keep our promises to communities to build a stronger health system.
As of todayƒ??s reports, the global number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has surpassed 100 000. 
As we mark this sombre moment, the World Health Organization (WHO) reminds all countries and communities that the spread of this virus can be significantly slowed or even reversed through the implementation of robust containment and control activities.
China and other countries are demonstrating that spread of the virus can be slowed an impact reduced through the use of universally applicable actions, such as working across society to identify people who are sick, bringing them to care, following up on contacts, preparing hospitals and clinics to manage a surge in patients, and training health workers.
WHO calls on all countries to continue efforts that have been effective in limiting the number of cases and slowing the spread of the virus. 
The 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action remains the worldƒ??s most progressive blueprint for advancing gender equality worldwide.
Twenty-five years after it was affirmed by 189 countries, what progress has been made in raising this blueprint off the page? 
International Womenƒ??s Day the World Health Organization, United Nations University - International Institute for Global Health and the British Medical Journal have launched a special series marking ƒ??Beijing+25ƒ??. 
It shines a spotlight on health, education, environment, work and other critical foundations of life as they empower or restrict the rights and well-being of girls and women.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the World Health Organization (WHO) are working together to combat novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
In support of this effort, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has provided US$10 million to the World Health Organization for the implementation of urgent measures to minimize the spread of the disease and to support countries with vulnerable health infrastructures.  
Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on behalf of WHO greatly appreciates this generous humanitarian gesture from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which will contribute significantly to efforts to safeguard global health. 
This Medical Product Alert relates to a series of confirmed falsified antimalarials circulating in West and Central Africa. 
Medicines subject of this alert display a similar logo to the outdated WHO Essential Drugs Programme logo. 
Since 2013, different falsified medicines, all displaying the outdated WHO Essential Drugs Programme logo, have been reported to the WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System by various stakeholders. 
The continued and widespread availability of these falsified medicines highlights a strong need for additional vigilance.
WHO previously published two alerts on this issue (No.132 in Oct 2014, and No.131 in March 2014) This WHO medical product alert N?ø1/2020 refers to falsified Quinine Sulphate 300mg presented in six different combinations of batch numbers, expiry and manufacturing dates (see Table 1).
The fraudulent use of the outdated WHO Essential Drugs Programme logo may create a false sense of product quality.
Twenty-five years ago, two global events ƒ?? the International Conference on Population and Development and the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing ƒ?? formally recognized that womenƒ??s health and reproductive choices cannot be separated from the social context of their lives.
Now, researchers have created a dataset which brings together national surveys from 74 countries, representing 3 million women.
For the first time, it allows them to describe trends in demand/use of modern contraceptives alongside social and economic indicators. 
The data is published in The Lancet Global Health and is authored by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the World Health Organization.
It shows that, over time, women are more likely to have their demand for modern contraception met in countries where gender equality and their educational opportunities improve.
It is almost five years now since the Nutrition Decade was declared. It is time to reflect back on its achievements so far. FAO and WHO are convening an open and inclusive dialogue with stakeholders for the mid-term review of the Nutrition Decade.
This review follows the ECOSOC Resolution 1989/84 regarding international decades, which provides that an appropriate inter-governmental body should appraise the implementation of a decadeƒ??s programme of work at the mid-point and at the end of the decade. 
The objectives of the Mid-term Review of the Nutrition Decade are to assess and evaluate the achievements in individual policy areas of the ICN2 Framework for Action, as reflected in the actions areas of the Work Programme of the Decade, over the time period from 2016 to 2020.
The Mid-term Review aims to identify focus areas for priority action and promising opportunities in each of the six action areas for future progress from 2021 to 2025
This assessment will guide the revision of the ƒ??living partƒ?? of the Work Programme of the Nutrition Decade as appropriate.
A Special Collection on Advances in Clinical Trial Design for Development of New Treatments for Tuberculosis has been released by PLOS Medicine. 
This Special Collection, that is now complete with the publication of its last paper, contains a series of articles that articulate the essential new steps in clinical research that will pave the way for the development of future optimal treatment for all forms of tuberculosis.
The Collection has been sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD-France), and coordinated by Dr Christian Lienhardt, Research Director at IRD-France and Dr Payam Nahid, Professor at University of California, San Francisco, USA. 
 Development of new TB treatments is very long and costly, and hampered by several methodological limitations.
The most commonly touted challenge in TB therapeutics remains the absence of a surrogate marker that can be readily measured and that estimates with adequate certainty the anticipated treatment effect in late stage clinical development.
New opportunities are emerging with the recent developments in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics methodologies, novel clinical trial designs, new biomarkers, as well as recent advances in molecular diagnostics.
A recently broadened and exciting pipeline of new candidate drugs compels us to revisit our current approaches to TB drug development, and based on the learnings of the last 50 years, to identify and seek consensus on best practices for future TB clinical trial designs.
GENEVA and Washington, D.C. ƒ?? A new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Solidarity Response Fund will raise money from a wide range of donors to support the work of the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners to help countries respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The fund, the first-of-its-kind, enables private individuals, corporations and institutions anywhere in the world to come together to directly contribute to global response efforts, and has been created by the United Nations Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, together with WHO.
ƒ??We are at a critical point in the global response to COVID-19 ƒ?? we need everyone to get involved in this massive effort to keep the world safe,ƒ? said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ƒ??We are immensely grateful to the UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation for coming forward to help us set up this fund. 
A lot of people and institutions have been saying they want to contribute to the fight against the novel coronavirus. Now they can.ƒ?
In a coordinated effort to combat the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have agreed to work closely to ensure the latest and most reliable information and tailored guidance reaches the global business community. 
An experimental antiviral pill developed by Merck & Co (MRK.N) could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe COVID-19, according to data that experts hailed as a potential breakthrough in how the virus is treated.
If it gets authorization, molnupiravir, which is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus, would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19.
Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said they plan to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for the pill as soon as possible and to make regulatory applications worldwide.
"An oral antiviral that can impact hospitalization risk to such a degree would be game-changing," said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
Although the majority of COVID-19 vaccines are only approved for use in adults aged 18 years and above, an increasing number of vaccines are now also being authorized for use in children.
Some countries have given emergency use authorization for mRNA vaccines for use in the adolescent age group (aged 12-17 years): BNT162b2 developed by Pfizer, and mRNA 1273 developed by Moderna.
In November 2021, one stringent regulatory authority approved the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 for the use in children aged 5-11.
Trials in children as young as age 3 years were completed for two inactivated vaccines (Sinovac-CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV) and these products were approved by Chinese authorities for the age indication of 3-17 years; although these vaccine products have received EUL for adults, they have not yet received WHO EUL for children.
Covaxin, an adjuvanted inactivated vaccine developed by Bharat, was approved in India for the age indication of 12-17 years; but not yet received WHO EUL for this age indication.
The Indian regulatory authorities have given approval to ZycovD, a novel DNA vaccine, for ages 12-17 years; however, this vaccine has not yet received WHO EUL.
Several COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing trials in younger age groups (including as young as 6 months of age), but results have not yet been published.
